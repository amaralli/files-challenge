		<p>Samwise Gamgee, better known as "Sam" appears in the Lord of the Rings series as the main character, Frodo's, best friend. He is a simple hobbit, starting off as nothing but a tender to Frodo's garden. After eavesdropping on Frodo and Gandalf's secret conversation about the One Ring, Sam is drafted in the Fellowship to protect Frodo. Throughout the novel, Sam offers his support as the truest friend there could be. Despite the hardships the ring burdens the Fellowship with, Sam always remains steadfast by his team, regardless of the fear he feels.</p>
